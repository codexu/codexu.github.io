# NoteGen

NoteGen is a cross-platform `Markdown` note-taking application dedicated to using AI to bridge `recording` and `writing`, organizing fragmented knowledge into a readable note.

## Why Choose NoteGen?

- Lightweight: [Installation package](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/releases) is **only about 20MB**, free with no ads or bundled software.
- Cross-platform: Supports Mac, Windows, Linux, and thanks to `Tauri2`'s cross-platform capabilities, will support iOS and Android in the future.
- Supports multiple recording methods including `screenshots`, `text`, `illustrations`, `files`, `links`, etc., meeting fragmented recording needs across various scenarios.
- Uses native `Markdown(.md)` as the storage format without modifications, making migration easy.
- Default support for local offline usage with real-time synchronization to `GitHub, Gitee private repositories`, history rollback, and WebDAV synchronization.
- `AI Assistant` to help you record and organize more efficiently, with support for customizing mainstream models.
- `RAG` support, turning your notes into your knowledge base with support for embedding models and reranking models.

## From Recording to Writing

NoteGen is divided into two pages: `Recording` and `Writing`. Their relationship is:

- Recording: Manual records using tools or generated by AI Assistant, which can be organized into notes.
- Writing: Can insert records or use AI to assist writing for in-depth content creation.

> [!TIP]
> Conventional note-taking applications typically don't provide recording functionality. Users need to manually copy and paste to record information, which greatly reduces recording efficiency. When faced with scattered record content, it requires significant effort to organize.

### Recording

The recording function is similar to an AI chatbot, but when conversing with it, you can associate it with already recorded content. By switching from conversation mode to organization mode, you can organize your records into a readable note.

The following auxiliary functions can help you record better:

- Tags: Used to distinguish different recording scenarios.
- Masks: Support for custom prompts to precisely control your AI assistant.
- Clipboard assistant: Automatically recognizes text or images in the clipboard and records them to the list.

### Writing

Writing is divided into two parts: File Manager and Markdown Editor.
