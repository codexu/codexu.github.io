## GitHub Image Hosting

The configuration method is similar to the synchronization configuration.

- Local/Image Hosting: Choose between using local storage as image hosting or using a GitHub repository as image hosting. Gitee does not support image hosting functionality.
- jsDelivr Acceleration: When enabled, after uploading images, jsDelivr links will be automatically used.
- GitHub will create an additional public repository for image hosting (private repositories will not allow normal access to images).
