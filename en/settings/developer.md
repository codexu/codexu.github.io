## Instructions

- Proxy, used to solve network problems. It's recommended to restart the application after configuration.
- Clear data information, including system configuration information and database (including records).
- Clear files (default workspace), including images and articles.
- Configuration file (JSON format) import and export. Importing a configuration file will overwrite the current configuration and take effect after restart.
