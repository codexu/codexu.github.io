# Default Model

Default model configuration refers to using different models for specific functions. Currently, three functions are supported:

- Record description, used to process records after OCR recognition and generate record descriptions.
- AI suggestions, AI suggestion prompts that generate content for the AI conversation placeholder on the record page.
- Translation, used for content translation scenarios.

::: tip
Some scenarios don't require powerful models; you can use lower-cost models for speed and cost efficiency.
